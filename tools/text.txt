INTRO
 JETMAN WAS NOT YOUR AVERAGE SPACE

 TRAVELER. HE LIVED IN THE GLORPUS
 
 GALAXY. A HUMBLE CLUSTER OF MINOR
 
 PLANETS WHERE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
 
 SYSTEM WAS BASICALLY, WELL... JETPACKS.
 
 EVERYONE ZIPPED AROUND IN SPACE SUITS
 
 LIKE CAFFEINATED MOSQUITOES. LIFE WAS
 
 SIMPLE: FLOAT, SIP COSMIC COFFEE,
 
 AND AVOID CRASHING INTO SATURNIAN
 
 BILLBOARDS.


 ONE FRIDAY EVENING, JETMAN AND HIS

 BUDDIES DECIDED TO HIT UP

 THE RUSTY COMET, THE HOTTEST PUB ON

 PLANET DOOGLE-7.

 DRINKS WERE STRONG, GRAVITY WAS LOW,

 AND SOMEONE KEPT PLAYING ROCKET MAN

 ON THE JUKEBOX UNTIL JETMAN STARTED

 CRYING FROM LAUGHTER, OR POSSIBLY...

 LACK OF OXYGEN.


 AFTER MANY NEBULA ALES AND A SUSPICIOUS

 GLOWING COCKTAIL CALLED

 THE WORMHOLE WRECKER, HIS FRIENDS

 WISELY BOOKED ROOMS AT THE ORBIT INN.

 JETMAN, HOWEVER, HAD OTHER PLANS!


 I DON'T NEED A HOTEL! HE DECLARED,

 WOBBLING LIKE A JELLYFISH IN A WIND

 TUNNEL. I'VE GOT MY JETPACK, AND A

 STRONG SENSE OF DIRECTION! I'LL BE

 HOME BEFORE YOU CAN SAY

 BLACK HOLE BURRITO!

 HOUR LATER, JETMAN WAS UPSIDE

 DOWN, FLOATING NEAR A TOTALLY

 UNFAMILIAR ASTEROID SHAPED LIKE

 A DUCK WEARING A SOMBRERO.


 UH... THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE PLANET

 BLOOP, HE MUMBLED, TRYING TO GPS

 HIS WAY HOME ON A CRACKED SPACE

 TABLET. IT KEPT REROUTING HIM THROUGH

 A SUN.


 NOW JETMAN IS STUCK SOMEWHERE IN 
 
 SPACE, WAVING DOWN PASSING COMETS 
 
 LIKE A GUY TRYING TO HITCHHIKE 
 
 IN THE VACUUM OF SPACE.


 FIVE MINUTES LATER, BONK!


 HE SLAMMED DIRECTLY INTO AN ASTEROID 

 SHAPED SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE A GOAT.

 JETMAN CRASH-LANDED ON A TINY UNKNOWN 

 PLANET CALLED SNIBBLE. 
 
 NOW HIS ROCKET PIECES ARE SCATTERED 
 
 ACROSS THE PLANET.

 HE STOOD UP, BRUSHING MOON DUST OFF 
 
 HIS VISOR. WELL, HE SIGHED,

 I GUESS I'M STARTING A FETCH QUEST.


 CAN WE HELP JETMAN FIND HIS ROCKET 

 PARTS AND GET HOME?
