Letting enemies "patrol" until the player is close, then home in.


To make movement less predictable, add a small random offset to the enemy's direction every few frames. This can be as simple as picking 
a random direction and adding it to the movement vector, or just flipping direction with a small probability.

With a 1/8 chance per frame, add +1 or -1 to the enemy's vertical or horizontal direction.
